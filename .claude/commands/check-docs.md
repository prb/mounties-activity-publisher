Review the recent changes in this conversation and check if any documentation needs updating.

Check the following documentation files against recent code changes:
- **architecture.puml** - PlantUML diagram showing system architecture
- **ARCHITECTURE.txt** - Text-based architecture diagram with metrics
- **README.md** - Project overview and getting started
- **OPERATIONS.md** - Operational procedures and manual invocation
- **ENVIRONMENTS.md** - Multi-environment deployment guide
- **spec.md** - Complete system specification

For each file:
1. Identify any sections that may be outdated based on recent changes
2. List specific discrepancies (e.g., "ARCHITECTURE.txt is missing the catchup function")
3. Ask if I should update them

Focus on:
- New Cloud Functions or changes to existing ones
- New Firestore collections or fields
- Changes to Cloud Tasks queues
- Changes to authentication/security
- Changes to deployment process
